- Grab a large heavy based non stick frying pan & place it over a high heat, add the oil. When the pan is hot – add the mushrooms.
- Grab another frying pan or saucepan thats slightly smaller than the mushroom pan & place it directly on top of the mushrooms. It will flatten the mushrooms and make sure they are being seared completely. Leave the mushrooms for 4-5 minutes to cook, applying some pressure to the top pan, which will squeeze the water out of them, making them extra meaty.
- After 5 minutes, remove the top pan and season the mushrooms with sea salt and pepper. Flip the mushrooms over then place the pan back on top & cook + press for a further 4 minutes.
- Once the mushrooms have cooked remove them from the pan and set them aside to slightly cool.
- Meanwhile add all the glaze ingredients (accept the cornflour) to a saucepan and place over a medium heat, bring the mix to a simmer.
- Allow to simmer for 5 minutes before whisking in the cornflour mixture.
- The liquid should thicken up into a lovely glaze like the consistency. If it becomes too thick add some water, and if too thin, slightly more cornflour/water mix or just allow it to reduce down.
- Next mix together the coating ingredients in a shallow bowl.
- Whisk together the batter ingredients in another bowl – adding enough water to make it a pancake batter style consistency.
- When the mushrooms are cool enough to handle, individually dip each mushroom first into the flour /panko mix then into the batter then back into the coating mixture, making sure they are coated all over evenly. Feel free to double dip them to get a thicker coating.
- To make them extra crispy, pre heat a large non stick frying pan over a medium heat with the frying oil. When the oil is hot (you can test by dropping in a bread crumb) add a couple of the coated mushrooms. Fry them on both sides for 3-4 minutes. When they’re golden & crisp, remove them from the oil & place them on to a plate lined with kitchen paper to soak up any excess oil.
- Alternatively, for a healthier alternative, you can bake the mushrooms until crispy in an oven set at 180 degrees C/356 degrees F for approximately 25 minutes.
Sprinkle over a little salt to keep them crisp until you’re ready to serve.
